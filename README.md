# burger

Devour some burgers, then make some more! 

This burger app is an assignment that combines MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) using an MVC pattern.

Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app stores every burger in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
